# Chip8js

A Chip-8 emulator written in TypeScript.

## Motivation

The main motivation of implementing this emulator is to introduce myself to emulator development, refresh my understanding of lower level programming conceps, and increase my familiarity with React and TypeScript.

Some conceps I refreshed or learned:

- Bitwise operators
- Underflow and overflow of unsigned values
  - I.e. how to implement that functionality in TypeScript
- How to implement core features of a CPU such as its registers, program counter, and memory
